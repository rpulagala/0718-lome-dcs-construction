# DCS Construction — Final Validation Report

**Date:** 2026-07-14 · **Build:** Phases 0–7 complete + deployed · **Verdict: Definition of Done met — MVP is live in production.**

**🟢 Deployed:** https://0718-lome-dcs-construction.vercel.app (Vercel + Neon Postgres + Vercel Blob). Production `/api/health` returns `{status:ok, db:ok}`; sign-in, the estimate→project flow, and photo display were verified on the live site.

## Gate status
| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run lint` | ✅ clean |
| `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) | ✅ clean |
| `npm run test` (Vitest) | ✅ **129 passing** (10 unit + 6 integration files, incl. client-portal auth) |
| `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright) | ✅ **11 passing** (4 spec files) |
| `npm run build` (`next build`) | ✅ green (19 routes) |
| `/api/health` (local + production) | ✅ `{status:ok, db:ok}` |
| Production deploy (Vercel) | ✅ live, migrations + seed applied |

## Definition of Done (prompt §24) — evidence
| Requirement | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Customer submits a request **with photos** | ✅ | `/request`; E2E `customer-journey` intake; `createWorkRequest.test.ts` |
| Stored + confirmation page + confirmation email | ✅ | confirmation page shows `DCS-YYYY-NNNNNN`; email logged (non-fatal) |
| Internal team notified of new requests | ✅ | intake alert to `intake_notify_emails` (Admin-settable) |
| Employees search / open / enlarge photos | ✅ | dashboard filters/search/paginate; detail lightbox |
| Assign / prioritize / change status | ✅ | Manage panel; `requestMutations.test.ts`; guarded state machine |
| Schedule + track site visits | ✅ | Schedule panel; `scheduling.test.ts` (double-booking, reschedule, cancel, complete) |
| **Estimates**: draft → send → accept/decline/revise | ✅ | Estimates panel; `estimatesProjects.test.ts`; `estimateStatus.test.ts` |
| **Projects**: convert, PM, dates, contract, milestones, progress | ✅ | Project panel + `/projects`; `estimatesProjects.test.ts`; `projectStatus.test.ts` |
| Managers track work across employees | ✅ | assignment + cross-project `/projects` view |
| Admin manages users / categories / settings | ✅ | `/admin/*`; `admin.test.ts`; E2E `admin.spec.ts` |
| Every change on a timeline / audit log | ✅ | `WorkRequestActivity` + status/assignment history + append-only `AuditLog` |
| **Server-side authorization enforced** | ✅ | `requireCan(...)` on every mutation; E2E `auth.spec.ts` (5 negatives) |
| Critical flows tested | ✅ | 131 automated tests across unit/integration/E2E |
| Responsive & accessible | ✅ (see notes) | semantic HTML, labels, `role="status"/"alert"`, keyboard-operable controls, accessible lightbox |
| Setup / deploy documented | ✅ | [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md), [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md), README |
| No known critical/high security issues | ✅ | [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) Phase-7 review |

## Security review summary
Reviewed the Phase-6 estimate/project surfaces plus a regression pass over prior phases:
- **Authorization** — all estimate/project/milestone mutations gated by `requireCan("estimate:manage"|"project:manage")` (MANAGER+); employees blocked from `/admin` and `/projects` (E2E-verified). No UI-only controls.
- **IDOR** — estimate/project surfaces are entirely staff-internal; a trusted MANAGER acting across requests is within the single-company trust boundary. No customer-facing route exposes these ids.
- **Injection** — Prisma parameterized queries only; no raw SQL; React output-encoding by default.
- **Money** — `Decimal` strings validated by regex; no floats; no non-serializable props crossing to client components.
- **Secrets/PII** — env-var secrets, `.env` git-ignored, structured logs omit secrets/tokens/PII.
- **Result:** no critical/high findings.

## Accessibility notes
- Forms use `<label>`/`htmlFor`; status messages use `role="status"`, errors use `role="alert"`.
- The photo lightbox is keyboard-operable with focus management (Phase 2).
- Controls are native buttons/inputs/selects — keyboard and screen-reader friendly.
- Layout verified responsive at 375 / 768 / 1440 px (dashboard table collapses to cards on mobile).
- *Recommended before public launch:* an automated axe pass in CI and a manual screen-reader sweep of the intake form.

## Known limitations / accepted for post-MVP
- Signed/expiring customer status links, CAPTCHA/bot provider wiring, security-header hardening, and a least-privilege DB role are seams/backlog (see SECURITY.md).
- External calendar sync is a `.ics` export + provider interface only (no OAuth).
- Estimate/attachment upload is a placeholder field (`attachmentKey`); the photo pipeline exists and can be reused when needed.
- E2E-created demo data is not auto-cleaned from the dev database; `npm run db:reset && npm run seed` restores a clean state.

## Operational note
After `prisma generate` (new models), **restart any long-running dev server** — it bundles a stale Prisma client and will throw on the new model. Fresh unit/integration runs are unaffected.
